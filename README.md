# StartMenuCleaner
A utility program to clean your programs list in the start menu.

I was annoyed of having a lot of folders with only one program or help links and uninstallers... So, I created this tool.

It shows you the programs list showed in the start menu and helps you cleaning it.

When you clean it, shortcuts will be removed, but they are still in a list stored in a `.json` backup file so that you can restore them later.

## Features

- Backup the programs list
- Add words to blacklist (i.e. `uninstaller`, `help`...)
- Rename entries
- Edit shortcuts link
- And other little features...
